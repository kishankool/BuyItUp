# BuyITUp Mobile App

Welcome to BuyITUp, a mobile app built using React Native and Expo! This app offers a convenient way to browse and select recipes that you can add to your cart. The app also features a secure login system utilizing OTP via SMS. Please note that the OTP sending functionality is powered by a trial Twilio account, so there might be some delays during OTP delivery. Don't worry, if it doesn't work on the first attempt, give it a couple more triesâ€”it's designed to work reliably!

- Expo CLI installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`).

## Features

### Recipe Listing

Browse through an extensive list of mouthwatering recipes. Each recipe is accompanied by a description and details about the ingredients and cooking process.

### Cart Management

Select your favorite recipes and add them to your cart. The cart keeps track of the recipes you want to try out.

### OTP Login

For a secure and convenient login experience, the app uses OTP via SMS. However, please note that the OTP sending feature is powered by a Twilio trial account. If you experience any delays or issues during the OTP delivery, be patient and try sending the OTP a few times. It will work reliably after a couple of attempts.

## Troubleshooting OTP

Since the OTP sending functionality is from a trial Twilio account, occasional delays may occur. If you don't receive the OTP immediately, try sending it two or three times. This approach has proven effective in ensuring successful OTP delivery.
